intial thought was to use Data.List.permutations
in let n = 10 in map f (permutations [1..n]) 
as let n = 10 in map f (Data.List.permutations [1..n])
after loading first.hs to see the result of 1..5 permutations which is 120.
As suggested in a hint for the permutation function itself
length (map length xss)

f z xs = map (insert at x) (take (lenght xs) [0..1])
(\y -> insert z y xs)
