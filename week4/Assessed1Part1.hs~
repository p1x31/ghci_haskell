{- The input String has the following format:

   * An integer n coded as a sequence of digits.
   
   * This is followed by exact n characters, have a tree write with
     show, that can be read with read.

   * A sequence of 0's and 1's (characters) representing a sequence of bits.

   The output should be some text.

{--- Decompression for a smarter compression algorithm: For a short
string or a random string, the Huffman code of the string is longer
than the string. In this case, we produce the original string with a '*'
at the front, indicating that no compression was performed. 

However, we need to simulate this using `charlength`, since we're
outputting a bitsequence as characters.  charlength is the bit-length
of a single character. We could change this to simulate a different
character encoding.  ---}
